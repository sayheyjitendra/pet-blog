        <p>
          One of the things that we love most about our feline friends is their
          independent nature. But that doesn’t mean we never want a good old
          snuggle with them! Some cat breeds are truly people-oriented and will
          almost always be happy to soak up all the attention that you can give
          them. You might find that they even follow you around the house and
          demand to be picked up. <br />
          If you’re looking for a new cat and want to maximize the chances of
          them being a cuddle-bug, then we recommend choosing one of these 15
          most affectionate breeds! Cats have many subtle ways of showing us
          that they care, and once you start spotting those signs, you’ll soon
          see that your cat loves you just as much as you love them.
        </p>

        <h2>Ragamuffin</h2>

        <p>
          The adorable Ragamuffin is a blend of the Ragdoll, Himalayan, and
          Persian breeds. Their coats have more variation in color than the
          Ragdoll. These cats take affection and loyalty to a new level and will
          follow their owners around the house and are always ready for a
          cuddle. They’re also outgoing and confident around visitors, so they
          make a great choice of cat for busy households. Ragamuffins crave
          company and are best suited to a household where someone is home most
          of the time.
        </p>

        <h2>Scottish Fold</h2>

        <p>
          The Scottish Fold breed is the result of a naturally occurring genetic
          mutation discovered in 1961 in Tayside, Scotland. These medium-sized
          cats have a stocky build. Scottish Folds have the endearing habit of
          relaxing in strange positions, like flat on their back or laid
          stretched out on their stomachs. They’re a relatively active breed and
          love playing in between cuddles with their owners. They don’t enjoy
          being left alone for long periods, so they need a home with plenty of
          company
        </p>

        <h2>Birman</h2>

        <p>
          The exact origins of the Birman are unclear, but legend has it that
          they were originally temple cats, and their distinctive appearance is
          due to being blessed by a temple goddess. The Birman has a similar
          Himalayan pointed coat as the Siamese but is far less vocal. They’re a
          calm and affectionate breed that loves to be picked up and fussed
          over. Birmans are smart and inquisitive, so expect them to always want
          to know exactly what you’re doing.
        </p>

        <h2>Ragdoll</h2>
        <p>
          Ragdolls are a modern breed, having only been developed in the 1960s.
          Their name is inspired by their adorable habit of flopping gently into
          the arms of whoever is holding them. They have placid and calm
          personalities and are always happy to sit on someone’s lap or snuggle
          up for a nap. While they’re calm, they do enjoy plenty of
          opportunities for active play. They’re a well-mannered breed, and
          while they love attention, they’re never overly demanding about it.
        </p>

        <h2>Kurilian Bobtail</h2>
        <p>
          The Kurilian Bobtail is a natural breed that originated on the Kuril
          Islands, located between Russia and Japan. They were prized locally
          for their mousing ability before their popularity spread elsewhere.
          They’re still a relatively unusual breed but have many endearing
          qualities. These outgoing cats love human company, and they actively
          seek out their families for attention and affection. The Kurilian
          Bobtail makes a fantastic family cat due to their adaptable nature.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
          There are thousands of purebreds and hybrid breeds that could have
          been added to this list. Almost any of the popular Poodle hybrids,
          like the Labradoodle, could have been added. We could have compiled an
          entire list of the different colors of Labrador, and then there are
          breeds like the Vizsla, which are loyal and loving but require more
          training.

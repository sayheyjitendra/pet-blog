        <p>
          If you want your dog to be obedient and well-behaved, you will need to
          invest time into training them properly. This can mean doing it
          yourself or hiring a professional dog trainer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          There are many different types of training for dogs. Some are
          specialized and prepare your dog for a specific job or activity.
          Others are meant to help you socialize your dog and teach them proper
          manners.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Behavioral training falls into the latter category. It can help curb
          undesirable behaviors such as barking, anxiety, and chewing. If your
          dog struggles with some of these unwanted behaviors, read on to learn
          more about behavioral training and how it might help you.
        </p>

        <h2>What Is Behavioral Training?</h2>

        <p>
          Behavioral training can also be referred to as behavior modification
          training. This is because you are teaching your dog to exhibit a
          positive or desired behavior even if you are not there to give them a
          verbal command. You want your dog to modify their behavior and learn
          for themselves what they should and should not do in a given
          situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The need for behavioral training arises because you have a problem and
          modification is needed to fix it. This can make it tricky because some
          of the undesirable behaviors exhibited by dogs are the result of prior
          trauma, especially in rescue dogs. Since they cannot tell you what
          they are thinking or what may have happened in the past, you need to
          pay close attention to behavior triggers to help them overcome the
          root of bad behavior. If you are a beginner dog owner, it may be best
          to seek professional training assistance to curb unwanted dog
          behaviors..
        </p>

        <h2>Leash Training</h2>

        <p>
          Every dog needs to learn to walk on a leash. Besides the fact that
          most areas have leash laws, there will be times when keeping your dog
          on a leash is for his own safety. Learn how to introduce your dog or
          puppy to the leash, then teach him how to walk properly on the leash,
          even beside you on a bike. A loose leash walk teaches your dog not to
          pull or lunge when on â€‹the leash, making the experience more enjoyable
          for both you and your dog.
        </p>

        <h2>Basic Commands</h2>

        <p>
          There are some basic dog training commands and dog tricks that every
          dog should know like come, speak, drop it, stay, back up, etc. Basic
          commands give your dog structure. In addition, they can help you
          overcome common dog behavior problems and will help keep your dog
          safe.
        </p>

        <h2>Proofing Behaviors and Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>
          Proofing is the last step in training your dog to do any new behavior.
          Learn how to proof behaviors so your dog will be as obedient at the
          park or a friend's house is he is in your own living room. Remember,
          just because you have reached the final stages of training, it doesn't
          mean that behavior problems won't crop up. Learn about the most common
          dog behavior problems and how to deal with them.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Remember that training is an ongoing process. You will never be
          completely finished. It is important to keep working on obedience
          training throughout the life of your dog.

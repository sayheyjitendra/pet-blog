        <p>
          Getting a dog is a truly exciting time. With thousands of breeds and
          hybrid breeds available, choosing the right breed for your first dog
          can be baffling. Above all, you must choose a dog that matches your
          lifestyle. If you’re an active person that loves to walk or run,
          choose a dog with a similarly high energy level. If you prefer to stay
          indoors, opt for something with lower energy requirements. If you’re
          looking for a family dog that’s good with children, opt for something
          that will love you all equally and be happy to join in the fun and
          games without being overly demanding.
        </p>

        <h2>Labrador Retriever</h2>

        <p>
          There’s a reason the Labrador Retriever has reigned supreme on the
          American Kennel Club’s list of most popular breeds for nearly 30
          years. Several reasons, in fact. He is friendly, mixes very well with
          people, dogs, and even cats. He is very smart and willing to please,
          hence, his use as a service dog. He is also active and energetic, so
          he will require regular exercise. Whether you’re a single person or
          family looking for their first pet, he is a loyal, loving, and
          responsive companion.
        </p>

        <h2>Golden Retriever</h2>

        <p>
          The Golden Retriever is very similar to the Labrador. He is loyal and
          loving, happy to show affection, and equally happy curled up in front
          of the fire or enthusiastically playing with his family members. His
          long hair gives him more appeal for some owners, but it will require
          regular brushing to ensure that he remains free from tangles and
          knotted fur.
        </p>

        <h2>Shih Tzu</h2>

        <p>
          The Shih Tzu was bred as a companion dog, and this is where he excels
          today: primarily, on the lap of his owner. They don’t have any hunting
          instincts, which means that they should be friendly and relaxed, and
          he shouldn’t pose any problems with other dogs or even cats. Their
          size makes them popular as a lap dog, but be aware that their coat
          will take regular tending.
        </p>

        <h2>Poodle</h2>
        <p>
          The Poodle is another very popular breed. He is responsive to training
          and while he requires regular exercise, he is very happy to give and
          receive attention. He loves children as much as he loves adults, too.
          Although there is no such thing as hypoallergenic dog fur, the
          Poodle’s coat is as close as you can get, but it will require ongoing
          maintenance to ensure it looks its best.
        </p>

        <h2>Cavalier King Charles</h2>
        <p>
          The Cavalier King Charles is a bright little dog that can switch from
          energetic and playful to lazy and prostrate in an instant. He will
          still need regular walks, and his long coat will take some attention
          to prevent it from becoming bedraggled, but he’s a great first-time
          dog because of his sweet and loving nature.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
          There are thousands of purebreds and hybrid breeds that could have
          been added to this list. Almost any of the popular Poodle hybrids,
          like the Labradoodle, could have been added. We could have compiled an
          entire list of the different colors of Labrador, and then there are
          breeds like the Vizsla, which are loyal and loving but require more
          training.
